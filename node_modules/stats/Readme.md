# stats

  JavaScript statistics library built on uglify-js, reporting all sorts of interesting (and non-interesting) stats. Comes complete with an extremely simple js API, as well as a CLI.

## Installation

     $ npm install -g stats

## Example

 The following is an example of `stats(1)` running against the nodejs core libraries, completing in less than 300ms.

```
 Î» projects: stats --totals node/lib

totals:
  loc: 14855
  bytes: 390.80 kb
  statements: 6547
  assignments: 3343
  functions: 868
  stringBytes: 10.28 kb
  arrayLiterals: 108
  objectLiterals: 99
  objectsCreated: 183
  regexpLiterals: 60
  strings: 1211
  numbers: 512
  throws: 91
```

## Statistics

 The following are currently supported:

  - **loc**: lines of code as shown in source
  - **statements**: total number of statements
  - **assignments**: total number of assignments
  - **functions**: total number of functions (both statement & expression)
  - **numbers**: total number of ... numbers :)
  - **throws**: total number of `throw`s
  - **strings**: total number of strings
  - **stringBytes**: total byte-length of all strings
  - **regexpLiterals**: total number of regexp literals
  - **arrayLiterals**: total number of array literals
  - **objectLiterals**: total number of object literals
  - **objectsCreated**: total number of objects initialized with `new`
  - **bytes**: byte-length of source

## API

### .parse(js)

  Returns statistics for the given string of `js`:

```js
var stats = require('stats');
console.log(stats.parse(str))
```

  Outputs something similar to:

```js
{ loc: 65,
  bytes: 1112,
  statements: 16,
  assignments: 9,
  functions: 3,
  stringBytes: 20,
  arrayLiterals: 0,
  objectLiterals: 1,
  objectsCreated: 1,
  strings: 4,
  numbers: 9,
  throws: 1 }
```

## CLI Usage

```

Usage: stats [options] [file|dir ...]

Options:

  -f, --format <name>  Output the given format. text, json
  -j, --json           Output JSON statistics
  -t, --text           Output human-readable plain-text stats
  -T, --totals         Output totals only
